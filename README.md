# Fish Blaster

We are inspired by the mini fish game ads that we always see on YouTube and other websites. We played some of them and realized that they were not fun and of bad quality. Initially, we wanted to create a similar game, but we soon realized that it was not a good idea. At last, we decided to create a quirky yet fun game.
